# encrypt-decrypt
This is a simple implementation to encrypt messages and insure that third parties do not get access the included imformation.
There are prompts all along to assist with the use of the program.
You can choose to encode or decode a message. You can decide to choose or generate a unique code for encoding.
This code is also required for decoding. This program is implemented with the single value decomposition.

I will be more than willing to supply any further type of assistance that might be required in the running of this program.

The program is quite straigh-forward and special characters can easily be included to enrich its alphabets-database!
